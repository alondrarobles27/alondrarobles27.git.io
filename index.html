                <p>Hi, I'm Alondra Robles — a senior at Carnegie Mellon 
                    University majoring in Information Systems with a minor in 
                    Software Engineering. I'm passionate about building technology 
                    that creates meaningful business impact. With experience in data 
                    analytics, software development, and consulting, I enjoy turning 
                    complex problems into practical, real-world outcomes.

                        <p>Built two interactive dashboards to track 
                            institutional KPIs and enrollment-related financial 
                            trends. Automated data cleaning and connected data 
                            sources like SQL databases and excel files into 
                            Power BI, reducing manual preparation time and 
                            enabling faster, data-driven decision-making. These 
                            dashboards gave finance leadership and stakeholders
